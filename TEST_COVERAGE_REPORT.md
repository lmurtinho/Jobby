## 🚨 Test Failures Analysis

### Critical Issues (Need Immediate Fix):
1. **Authentication Registration** - User registration endpoint failing
2. **Resume Upload Workflow** - Skills extraction not working in integration test

### Infrastructure Issues (Non-Critical):
3. **Production Dependencies** - Missing gunicorn, psutil packages
4. **Health Endpoint** - Missing database status reporting
5. **CORS Configuration** - Method not allowed on OPTIONS requests

### Minor Issues:
6. **Memory Testing** - Missing psutil dependency for stress tests
7. **Deployment Health** - Some deployment-specific tests failing

---

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### **Immediate (High Priority)**:
```bash
# Fix user registration endpoint
pytest app/tests/unit/test_auth_endpoints.py::TestAuthenticationEndpoints::test_register_endpoint_success -v

# Fix integration workflow test
pytest app/tests/integration/test_complete_workflow.py -v

# Install missing production dependencies
pip install gunicorn psutil
```

### **Short Term (Medium Priority)**:
```bash
# Improve LinkedIn scraper coverage
# Add more unit tests for app/scrapers/linkedin_scraper.py

# Enhance health endpoint
# Add database status to health check response

# Fix CORS configuration
# Enable proper OPTIONS method handling
```

### **Long Term (Low Priority)**:
```bash
# Increase Claude client coverage
# Add comprehensive unit tests for AI integration

# Improve config module coverage
# Test edge cases in environment variable handling
```
