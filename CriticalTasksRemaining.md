‚è∫ üéØ Critical Tasks Remaining - Prioritized by Impact & Urgency

  üö® CRITICAL - Production Blockers (Must Fix Immediately)

  1. Fix Production Dependencies & Health Checks ‚è∞ 2 hours

  Current Issue: Missing psutil, gunicorn not properly configured, health
  endpoint incomplete
  Impact: Cannot deploy to production, monitoring will fail
  Tests Failing: 4 deployment health tests

  # Tasks:
  - pip install psutil gunicorn (fix requirements installation)
  - Enhance health endpoint to include database status
  - Fix CORS configuration for frontend integration
  - Resolve resume upload authentication in production mode

  2. Fix Day 5 AI Workflow Integration Test ‚è∞ 1 hour

  Current Issue: Semantic matching quality insufficient (sporadic failure)
  Impact: Core AI functionality reliability concerns
  Tests Failing: 1 critical Day 5 integration test

  üî• HIGH PRIORITY - Core Feature Gaps (Launch Blockers)

  3. Implement Real Job Scraping ‚è∞ 6-8 hours

  Current Status: Mock data only, scrapers exist but not fully implemented
  Impact: No real job data = unusable product
  Business Risk: High - users will see no real jobs

  # Missing implementations:
  - LinkedInScraper.scrape_jobs() - actual scraping logic
  - RemoteOKScraper.scrape_jobs() - API integration
  - RSSParser.parse_feeds() - feed processing
  - Background job scheduling for daily scraping

  4. Email Notification Service ‚è∞ 4 hours

  Current Status: AI notification system exists but no actual email sending
  Impact: Users won't receive job alerts
  Dependencies: SendGrid integration, email templates

  5. Database Migration & Production Setup ‚è∞ 3 hours

  Current Status: Development-only database setup
  Impact: Cannot deploy with proper database schema
  Tasks: Alembic migrations, production database configuration

  üìä MEDIUM PRIORITY - User Experience & Functionality

  6. Frontend Components & Pages ‚è∞ 8-12 hours

  Current Status: Backend complete, frontend foundation tests exist but
  components missing
  Impact: No user interface = unusable product
  Components Needed:
  - Dashboard with AI insights
  - Job search and filtering
  - Profile management
  - Resume upload interface
  - Settings and preferences

  7. Background Job Processing (Celery) ‚è∞ 4 hours

  Current Status: Celery mentioned in requirements but not implemented
  Impact: No automated job scraping, email sending
  Tasks: Redis setup, Celery workers, job scheduling

  8. Production Error Handling ‚è∞ 2 hours

  Current Status: Basic error handling exists
  Impact: Poor production debugging and user experience
  Tasks: Structured logging, error monitoring, user-friendly error pages

  üîí LOW PRIORITY - Production Polish (Post-Launch)

  9. Security Hardening ‚è∞ 3 hours

  - Rate limiting implementation
  - Input validation strengthening
  - Security headers
  - API key rotation

  10. Performance Optimization ‚è∞ 4 hours

  - Database query optimization
  - Caching layer (Redis)
  - API response time monitoring
  - Memory usage optimization

  11. Monitoring & Alerting ‚è∞ 3 hours

  - Sentry error tracking
  - Performance monitoring
  - Health check alerts
  - Business metrics tracking

  ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (Next 4 Hours)

  Phase 1: Fix Production Blockers (1 hour)

  1. Install missing dependencies (psutil, verify gunicorn)
  2. Fix health endpoint to include database status
  3. Configure CORS for frontend
  4. Fix resume upload production authentication

  Phase 2: Stabilize Core AI (1 hour)

  1. Debug and fix Day 5 AI workflow test inconsistency
  2. Ensure semantic matching reliability
  3. Verify all AI endpoints work in production mode

  Phase 3: Real Data Integration (2 hours)

  1. Implement basic job scraping for RemoteOK (easiest API)
  2. Add RSS feed parsing for immediate job data
  3. Test end-to-end with real job data
