## 🔄 Dependency Graph
Some components must be built before others:


## 🧪 Testing Strategy
Following Outside-In TDD approach:

1. **Integration Test**: `test_complete_workflow.py` drives all development
2. **Component Tests**: Each component gets unit tests as it's built
3. **Continuous Validation**: Re-run integration test after each component
4. **Issue Closure**: Close GitHub issues as acceptance criteria are met

## 🎉 Success Metrics
The workflow is complete when:
- [ ] High-level integration test passes end-to-end
- [ ] All GitHub issues are resolved
- [ ] Full AI Job Tracker functionality works
- [ ] User can: register → upload resume → get job matches → analyze skills → receive alerts

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Start with highest priority issues first
2. Follow TDD: write failing unit test → implement → make test pass
3. Regularly run integration test to see progress
4. Update this roadmap as issues are completed
